			<h4><b>For general health and anti-aging benefits</b></h4>
			<p>Green Tea is loaded with polyphenols like flavonoids and catechins, which function as powerful anti-oxidants. This means that it can reduce the formation of free radicals in the body, and eventually protects our cells and molecules from damage. These free radicals are known to play a role in aging as well as all sorts of diseases. Another powerful compound in green tea is the anti-oxidant Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG), which is known to treat various diseases. In fact, this could be the main reason why green tea is considered to have such powerful medicinal properties.

			<h4><b>To stay mentally sharp and alert</b></h4>
			<p> The key active ingredient for this purpose is caffeine, which is a known stimulant. Green tea doesn’t contain as much caffeine as coffee or any other form of tea, but it has enough to produce a response without causing the 'jittery' effects associated with too much caffeine. What caffeine does in the brain is to block an inhibitory neurotransmitter called Adenosine. This way, it actually increases the firing of neurons and the concentration of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. Green Tea also has L-theanine, which is what increases the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which has anti-anxiety effects on the body and the mind.

			<h4><b>Green Tea could prevent cancer</b></h4>
			<p> It is common knowledge that green tea is an excellent source of powerful anti-oxidants. That is the reason why trials are on to determine whether it can reduce your risk of certain types of cancers. 
			</p>
			
			<h4><b>Green tea could protect an aged brain</b></h4>
			<p>Multiple studies show that the catechin compounds in green tea can have various protective effects on neurons in test tubes and animal models, which indicates that it could potentially lower the risk of Alzheimer’s as well as Parkinson’s.
			</p>
			
			<h4><b>Green tea can improve oral health</b></h4>
			<p>The catechins in green tea can do this as well! Some studies show that these catechins can kill bacteria and inhibit viruses like the influenza virus, which means that it could potentially lower your risk of infections. Green tea is also associated with improved dental health as well as a lower risk of cavities and could also work on getting rid of bad breath.
			</p>
			
			<h4><b>Green tea could reduce chances of cardio-vascular diseases</b></h4>
			<p>Green tea is also dramatically known to increase the anti-oxidant capability of the blood, which protects the LDL cholesterol particles from oxidation. This of course, boosts the health of the heart. Given the beneficial effects on risk factors, it is not surprising to see that green tea drinkers have up to a 31% lower risk of developing cardio-vascular diseases.
